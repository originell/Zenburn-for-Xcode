Difference between Inconsolata and Inconsolata-dz
-------------------------------------------------
Quoted from the modifier's page:

> I love the font Inconsolata. At bigger sizes and higher resolutions, it looks incredibly smooth and clear, and avoids the messy sort of feeling that Monaco gains as text density increases.
> One thing that bothered me about Inconsolata, however, was the fact that its single and double quotes were slightly slanted or curly. It especially bothered me when using single quotes and commas, as the two looked visually similar, and my eye kept jumping levels.

Here's the official comparison image:
